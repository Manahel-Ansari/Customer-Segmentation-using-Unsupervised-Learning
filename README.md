## Intelligent Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing
Customer segmentation refers to the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups that share similar characteristics, behaviors, or purchasing patterns, enabling businesses to better understand their clientele and design tailored strategies. This study applied unsupervised machine learning to perform customer segmentation on a retail dataset in order to support data-driven decision-making and personalized marketing. The dataset was first prepared by handling missing values, parsing dates, and removing irrelevant features. New attributes were engineered to capture key behavioral and demographic aspects, such as age, total spending, number of purchases, average basket size, channel usage proportions, and responsiveness to promotional campaigns. To ensure fair treatment of variables with different scales and reduce the effect of outliers, RobustScaler was applied, and categorical features were numerically encoded. K-Means clustering was employed, and the optimal number of clusters was assessed using both the elbow method and silhouette scores. When k=2, customers were divided into two broad categories: high-income, high-spending loyal customers and lower-income, low-spending, less responsive customers. Increasing the granularity to k=4 revealed more nuanced groups, namely super-loyal high spenders, low-income minimalists, digital value-seekers, and mature affluent spenders. Although k=2 achieved a stronger silhouette score, indicating cleaner separation, the k=4 segmentation provided deeper behavioral insights that can inform more precise targeting through differentiated marketing campaigns, loyalty rewards, and engagement strategies. Ultimately, this approach demonstrates how unsupervised learning can uncover hidden patterns in customer data and transform them into actionable intelligence for strategic business growth.
